        <P style="color: rgb(250, 70, 85, 0.3);"> HEYYYYYYYYYY ITS USING RGB. RGB WILL HAVE VALUE FROM 0 TO 255 IN ORDER OF R  G  B & THEN WE CAN PUT ALPHA [0.0 TO 1] WHERE IT DENOTES THE TRANSPARENCY</P>
        <hr>

        <p>        the colos are also stted in form of hex
        </p>

        <p>#rrggbb

            Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
            
            For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00.
            
            Another example, #00ff00 is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 00.
            
            To display black, set all color parameters to 00, like this: #000000.
            
            To display white, set all color parameters to ff, like this: #ffffff.</p>

                    HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.

HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity).

HSL Color Values
In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:

hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.
